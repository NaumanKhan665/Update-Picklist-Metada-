# Update Meta Data of picklist values.
A picklist field has been added to the parent object.
The picklist field auto-populates values from the child object.
When a user creates a child record, its record name automatically populates as a picklist value for the parent object.
The Tooling API was used to update the metadata of the picklist field.
